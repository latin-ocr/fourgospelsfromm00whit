ornamented further by the addition of well-drawn, though rather primi-
tive figures of birds, also roughly coloured; and the blank spaces at the
end of the Chapters and gospels are similarly ornamented with birds,
beasts, and fishes; the drawing of the beasts and fishes however is far
more primitive and schoolboy-like, and lacks the boldness and grace
which characterise the birds. The titles of the gospels also, which
are placed in the centre at the head of each page, are frequently
inscribed within roughly drawn and uncoloured figures, generally of quite
imaginary animals.

As regards the colours used for the capital letters and the initial sen-
tences of the Gospels, green, brown, vermilion and crimson are the only
colours employed throughout the MS.; with the exception of the brown
they have all lasted well, though occasionally they have come off on to
the opposite page. ,

The largest and most representative piece of ornamentation is on
fol. 202 b, the page which originally ended the MS„ and which contains
the subscription of the scribe. A large cross occupies the middle of the
page, and extends down the greater part of its length 3 it is divided by a
vertical line along the upright part of the cross, and by a horizontal line
running along the cross-beams, and one side of the cross is painted crimson,
the other brown ; a large number of oblong and lozenge-shaped ornaments,
apparently meant to represent jewels, are let into the cross, and these are
painted green ; in the head of the cross is placed the half-length portrait
of a man, evidently intended for the scribe himself, and on the two arms
are seated birds, while hanging from these arms are the A on the one
side, the Ω on the other. In the centre of the cross is written ‘ego
ualerianus scripsi.’ Silvestre notices that the signature of a scribe,

though comparatively common in Greek MSS.‚ is rare in Latin; but
besides the well-known srequency of signatures in Irish1 and Saxon

² In the Book of Durrow (7th or 8th century), there is at the end of the book the following
subscription, ‘ Rogo beatitudinem tuam sce praesbitere patrici ut quicumque hunc libellum manu
tenuerit meminerit columbae scriptoris. qui hoc scripsi liimet euangelium per xii dierum spatium,
gtia dffi ffiis. s.' (Abbott, Euangeliorum Versio Antehieron.(Dublin, 1884), p. xix. In a St. Gall
MS. of the 9th century we have ‘ Psalterium hoc domino semper sancire curaui Wolfcoz, sic
supplex nomine qui uocitor’ (Wattenb. Sclzrzjftw. p. 419). The Book of Armagh (9th century)
bears the name of the scribe ‘ Ferdomnach' ; so do the Gospels os Macregol (also 9th century)
and the Gospels of Maelbrigte (A.D. 1138).

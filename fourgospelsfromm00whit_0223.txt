ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS

TO

OLD-LATIN BIBLICAL TEXTS‚ NOS.I AND II.

We are able, partly from our own revision, partly from the kind infor-
mation given by reviewers and friends, to point out the following
additions and corrections to the two previous volumes of Old-Latin
Biblical T exts, which we earnestly request our readers to note in the
margin of the pages where they occur. The most important corrections
of No. I are re-printed here for convenience together with a few marked
with an asterisk‚ which have been since discovered.

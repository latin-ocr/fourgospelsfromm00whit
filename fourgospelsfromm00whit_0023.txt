§·5. RELATION OF q TO OTHER OLD-LATIN
TEXTS.

Dr. Hort in his ‘Introduction’ 1 places q among the Italian class of
MSS„ the third type ‘due to various revisions of the European texts,
made partly to bring it into accord with such Greek MSS. as chanced to
be available, partly to give the Latinity a smoother and more customary
aspect. In itself the process was analogous to that by which the
European text must have been formed, on the supposition that it was of
African parentage3 but as we shall see presently, the fundamental text
now underwent more serious changes owing to the character of the
Greek MSS. chiefly employed? And again2: ‘ Two other MSS. (f, q),
and one or two fragments, must be classed as “ Italian ”. ’ In two points
then Dr. Hort would place q along with f (Brixianus), as against such
European MSS. as a (Vercellensis), b (Veronensis), z‘ (vindobonensis),
etc.; first in the Latinity‚ and secondly in the underlying Greek text.
I venture to think, however, that, though in the underlying Greek text,
q may run with f against a, b, etc„ yet in the Latinity this is less the
case, and that q represents a somewhat older type of text. It does not
indeed, so far as I have been able to examine it, represent any one type
of text for long consistently3 it agrees sometimes with a against b,
though more frequently and noticeably with b against a ; occasionally it
presents what appear to be genuine African readings, now and then it
agrees with the rather peculiar text of D, and occasionally it stands
quite alone. Yet the general impression left on the mind as one studies
the text is that if it be Italian in its readings, it is European in its ren-
derings 3 it presents a text which seems either to have been the subject
of an earlier and less complete revision than that off, or else to have
been European in its base, while a later corrector has attempted to
bring it into conformity with the Italian type, by deleting or inserting
such passages as he thought proper. While attempting to correct the
readings, however, he has not altered the Latinity so thoroughly as to

RELA TION OF q TO OTHER OLD-LA TIN TEX T S. xliii

tinct¹y characteristic of the European class of MSS„ and there are but
few in which q agrees with f against the older family. We have the
‘ dabit’ of d, f, i, q, Am. in Luke xi. 11 against the ‘ porriget ' of a and
b 3 ‘ miratae sunt ’ in v. 14, d, f, q, Am. against the ‘ stupebant ’ or ‘ obstu-
pebant ' of a, b, τ’, etc.; ‘paenitet me' in xvii. 4 with f, Am. against
the ‘paeniteor’ of b, d, and the ‘paenitentiam ago' of (a) and ες ν. 8,
‘ post haec ’ with d, f, Am. against the ‘ postea ' of a, e, and the ‘ sic ' of b.
These are about all the cases that we can notice of agreement with the
revised family against the older European group.

On the other side the agreements with b are both numerous and
important, and we may instance: xi. 21, ‘ea quae possidet’ (b, q, Am.)
against ‘omnia quae possidet’ (f); 22, ‘distribuet' against ‘dividet’
of f3 xiii. 17, ‘ aduersario eius’ against ‘ qui resistebant ei‚' and
‘quae uiderant fieri ad ipso' against ‘ quae uidebatur fieri ab eo ’ς
25, ‘ et pulsare' against ‘ et pulsauerit ostium '; 32, ‘ite dicite ’ against
‘ite et dicite' ; xvii. 6, ‘ utique obaudisset uobis' against ‘et oboe-
diret uobis ’3 12, ‘ingredienti ei ’ against ‘ curn ingrederetur,' and ‘ quodam
castello ’ against ‘ quoddam castellum '; 18, ‘ rediret et . . . ageret' against
‘ reuerteretur et daret‚' and ‘ gratias’ against ⁶ gloriam '; 22, ‘ ut ' instead
of ‘quando ' before ‘ desideretis ' ; 24, ‘fulgurans de caelo lucet in his sub
caelo sunt' is read by b, q alone, against ‘coruscans in his quae sub
caelo sunt fulget’ off, while the other MSS. differ both from f and q,
and also among themselves; 27, ‘ nubebant ' against ‘nubtum dabant ’ς
xix. 4, ‘illa parte ' against ‘inde '; 7, ‘ murmurauerunt ' against ‘ murmu-
rabant‚' and ‘deuertit' against ‘intrauit ’3 8, ‘quid alicui ' against ‘ quid
aliquem'3 15, ‘quantum quisque' against ‘quis quantum.’ These in-
stances, and more might be quoted, shew pretty conclusively‚ we think,
that in the great mass of the text and in turns of expression q is really
a text of the b and not of the f type.

The peculiar readings of q in these chapters do not seem to present
us with anything striking, or suggestive as to any further light on the
origin of the MS.; they are as follows z—xi. 16, ‘ab eo de celo quaere-
bant,’ q standing alone in arranging the words in this order3 20, ‘ utique '
before ‘ praeuenit' against the ‘ certe ' of a2‚ ‘profecto ' off, ἱ, Am„ ‘ for-
sitam’ of di xiii. 24, ‘querunt introire et non potuerunt' against the

‘ quaerunt intrare et non poterunt ' of most of the other MSS. In xvii. 7

and yet the following leaf (i. e. Fol. 16 in the original state of the MS„
F ol. 15 in its present condition) is the first leaf of aperfect quaternion,
and the seven gatherings following are all complete quaternions; room
for Fol. 15 must therefore be found in the mutilated gathering, and it
must have contained nine leaves. After the eight complete quaternions‚
comes at F ol. 79 another gathering, which has been mutilated 3 it begins
at Matt. xxvii. 54, and consists at present of nine whole leaves, with the
edges of three more still visible3 the three first leaves of this gathering
are in St. Matthew and in their right order (F ol. 79—81); then (F ol. 82-87)
are six leaves containing the end of St. John and the beginning of St. Luke,
and after this may be seen the projecting edges of the three sheets of
vellum whose other halves gave us St. Matthew xxvii. 54 soll. 3 the three
pages however have been cut out, and, together with the rest of the

“ quaternion proper, are bound up later in the book, at the beginning of

St. John's Gospel, forming part of an imperfect quaternion which we find
there (Fol. 203-207). Now if we bring these five leaves back to their
original position, and expel the intruding leaves 82—87‚ we shall get our
quaternion entire (Fol. 79—-81 St. Matthew, 203-207 St. John). After
this we have three regular quaternions (F ol. 208—2 31), and then apparently
ten leaves, or possibly nine, are missing: the gathering must have been
a quiniou, or else a quaternion with an extra leaf, as the gatherings before
and after it are perfect. It is followed by a quaternion (Fol. 232-239),
and the next page (240⁸) is a fragment of a leaf from St.John xxi. 8 foll„
and quite out of place in its present position. Fol. 240b begins a
gathering consisting of 240b, 241, then a page left unnumbered by
mistake, and then Fol. 242-246 ; this makes a quaternion. After this
come five complete pageS, to which we might add in its right place the
fragment bound at 240⁸, forming altogether a ternion. This is at the
end of the Book as it now stands, and we have to go back to the middle
for the rest of the Gospels, viz. the end of St. John, and the whole of
St. Luke and St. Mark. After the above—mentioned ternion we place in
their right order the six intruding leaves found at the end of St. Matthew
(Fol. 82—87); these give us another ternion. Then (F ol. 88—95) comes a
quaternion, followed by two quinions (Fol. 96—115)‚ and these in turn
followed by five quatemions, taking us on to page 155. Here ends the
consecutive portion os St. Luke; a leaf is now missing, and the four

1 INTRODUCTION.

Here we have some fifty-five instances of interesting relations
between q and other texts, and though the balance is a little disturbed
by a very strong stream of Italian influence towards the end of the
second chapter, yet the result on the whole is much the same in St. Mark
as in the other Gospels. Even allowing the f readings at the end of
the list, the number os agreements with that MS. against b is only six-
teen, while there are thirty cases of agreements with b against f; and as
before the majority of the agreements with b are in rendering, the
majority of those with f are in reading. Amongst the b renderings we
may notice the term ‘ expello ' (i. 39) of casting out devils, instead of the
Italian ‘ eicio,' which has been adopted into regular use in the' Vulgate3
in ii. 5, ‘ remissa,' not ‘dimissa sunt‚’ and in v. 8 ‘quid cogitarent' instead
of ‘ quod c.' as a translation of ὅτι οὕτως διαλογίζονται (or perhaps τί οὕ. δ.);
in ii. 17 the interesting ‘ egeo ’ is found against ‘opus habeo ' off, and in
v. 21 ‘alioquin' against ‘ne’; in v. 23 we note ‘segetes' against ‘sata,'
and in v. 726 ‘intrare ' instead of ‘ introire.’ The composite character of
the text of q is however clearly shewn in the latter verses of the second
chapter, where alternate European and Italian readings occur in the
closest proximity ; after shewing a pronounced European text in the
17th and 18th verses, we have in v. 19 the addition of ‘quantum temporis
secum habuerint sponsum non possunt ieiunare,’ which is found in a
slightly different form in f, Am„ but entirely omitted by the Europeans ;
then for two verses q sides with the European family, then changes over
to f; in ν. 22 sides first with one, then with the other, though on the
whole with s 3 then in vv. 23, 24 inclines towards b, and finally ends the
chapter in the closest alliance with f.

We are only getting brought out in a more marked and emphasised
form in this second chapter of St. Mark, the same features which we
have found elsewhere. The fact that q, if we take all its readings into
consideration, cannot be classed with any one definite branch of the Old-
Latin family, but has come under the influence of every group in turn,
may be considered almost established: but if we consider it in the vast
bulk of its readings, not merely in the fallacious ‘test-passages ’ (fallacious
because they would be the first to be altered by a reviser, who might
leave the rest untouched)‚ but throughout its text, in slight turns of
expression and habitual use of small, apparently unimportant groups of

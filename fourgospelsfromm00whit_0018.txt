copus, confetz'm, Agusto (Luke ii. 1). Letters are dropped at the end of
words, giving us such forms as accesserun( t), plu(s)‚ ueneri(t),praeparatu(s)‚
sun(t), uocan(s), and also at the beginning, as in (i)bz‘, (u)tique. These
instances seem to point to careless pronunciation rather than careless
writing; but for the following the scribe must surely be responsible 2——

contracted form in this way, and it may possibly serve to identify the
locality in which our book was written; ifzs is as usual found sor the
contraction of the Sacred name, but Hz's is found in Luke iv. 1 (cf. its
frequent use in Cod. Bobiensis k); thensaurus, puplicanus‚ profeta, adu-
lescens are regularly employed, as also Moyses, not Moses; absconsus,
absconditus are both sound; the form nequa is judged by Bishop
Wordsworth to be not a mistake‚ but an old indeclinable noun¹.

The other usual contractions and abbreviations are found3 ds and
das, isl as a rule for Israel, though 2'2‘5 is also found. The line over, or

occurs except at the end of a line3 final -us, -ue, or -uz't is marked by
the sign ς ; the most frequently occur-ring ligatures are ae, ant, uc, ue,
ui, ur, us, and ns. Though the numerous corrections by the first hand

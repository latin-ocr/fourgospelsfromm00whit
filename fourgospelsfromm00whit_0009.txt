EXTERNAL DESCRIPTION. vii

a writing rougher and more careless than that of the previous century.
Though unlike the writing of the 5th and 6th centuries, at the same time
it seems quite different from the careful uncials which marked the revival
of the 8th century and the Caroline times. The Editors of the Palaeogra-
phical Society's faesimiles ¹ remark apropos of this 7th century, ‘once past
the year 600, the decay of uncial writing rapidly advances ; the letters
lose uniformity and become mis-shapen‚ and, though there is occasionally Α
a calligraphic revival‚ as in MSS. of the 8th century, the trained eye
detects the imitative character of the writing‚’ and they cite as a charac-
teristic MS. of the 7th century the Ashburnham Pentateuch (pl. 234), a
MS. which shews a strong general resemblance to the Codex Monacensis,
and is supposed to have been written in North Italy. We may notice

also that in the printed catalogue of the library, as we saw above, it is
assigned to the 7th century, and also that another German scholar, in a

small work containing notices of MSS. in the Munich Library ², cites it
as of the 6th or 7th century. ¹

The book contains in its present mutilated state 251 leaves of vellum,
usually stout in texture and of a yellow tinge, though mixed with sheets
of whiter and thinner skin ; it measures 9}{ inches by 85⁵3 (in centimetres
25.1 >< 21.1). The pages are divided into two columns, ruled on the
average with about 20 lines; and there are from 12 to 16 letters in a
line. The writing is on the whole well preserved, though in parts the ink
has faded to a light brown colour. The writer is the same throughout, and
though careless‚ as his numerous slips shew, had by no means an unprac-
tised hand. The initial sentences of the Gospels, and of the chapters
into which each Gospel is divided, are marked by capital letters, orna-
mented in colours, but without gold, while the two or three lines following
them are also written in colours and in letters slightly larger than those
of the rest of the book. The capital letters vary in size, but are always
considerably larger than the rest of the text3 the outlines are drawn in
ink, and the colours laid on in diagonal patterns. They are frequently

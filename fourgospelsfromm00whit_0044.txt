xlii INTRODUCTION.

all the more valuable, as it will be unconscious testimony disclosed by
the way, when they were being quoted with a different aim.

There are some sixty—three instances in the analysis of a2 and s in
which q presents us with readings of any interest as shewing its relation
to other MSS. Out of these sixty-three instances there are thirty-four
of agreement with b against s, and only nine of agreement with f against
b; 'in eight readings q stands alone, and in eight it agrees with the com-
posite text offf2 against both b and f

To take the more noticeable cases of reading—as opposed to ren-
dering—first: in Luke xi. 13 the clause ‘cum autem haec dixisset ad?
duxerunt ad eum unum daemoniacum surdum et mutum’ found in f, and
with minor variations in a2, c, d, is omitted by b, τ’, q and Am.3 inv. 22
‘ eius ' is omitted after ‘ spolia ’ in b, q, but inserted in the other MSS.; in
v. 25 ‘ scopis mundatam ' is read by b, i, q, A m„ while f (with l, δ) insert
‘vacantem' as well; in v. 28 ‘ ad eos’ is added after ‘ dixit’ in b, i, q,
but omitted in d, e, f, Am. In xiii. 17 the simple ‘praeclarius' is read
· in b, i, q against the ‘ uniuersis praeclaris uirtutibus ' off, the other MSS.
agreeing in inserting either ‘uniuersis' or ‘ omnibus?

These are all the noticeable cases of differences of reading which
imply a variation in the underlying Greek text, and, as we shall see, they
are paralleled ‘by about an equal number of cases in which q has f readings
opposed to those of b; these are as follows :— ,

Luke xi. 13 ‘spiritum sanctum,’ f, q, (cp. Am, ‘spiritum bonum'),
against ‘bonum datum ' or ‘bona data' of the European MSS.; v. 18
the addition of ‘ satanan eicit' to ‘si satanas,' before ‘in seipsum diuisus
est‚' is found in f, τ’, q, but not in a2‚ b or d 3 v. 24 (d) f, q have ‘loca arida ’
against ‘loca quae non habent aquam ’ of b (i), while a2 and Ambrose in
his commentary on St. Luke combine the two readings in ‘arida loca
quae aquam non habent.’ In xiii. 33 the clause ‘ uerumtamen oportet me
hodie et cras et sequenti ire’ is found with slight variations in f, q, Am„
and, in a slightly different form, also in a, d, e, but is omitted in ὖ,- z‘.
Thus in cases of reading q seems to hold a middle place between b and'f
in St. Luke as in the other Gospels; it is revised in some places, unre-
vised in others.

If we examine its renderings the conclusion suggested by the other
Gospels will be considerably strengthened3 the large majority are dis-

xxii INTRODUCTION.

assimilate it in minuter points to the Italian type; in its vocabulary and
turns of expression q shews a sar closer affinity to b than to any other
MS. ; b indeed seems to be almost a typical European MS„ as the other
MSS. of European and of Italian origin, such as a‚f‚ h, z', q, r, all re-
semble b more closely than they resemble each other.

This revision in the text of q will be brought out more clearly if we
select first a few specimen readings in which it seems to have taken
place (though of course many cases may be found in which the text has
not been assimilated to that of the f group) 3 this will shew how far the
revision has progressed3 a few selections from a series of tables which Ι
am compiling on the renderings of Greek words in the Old-Latin MSS.
will again shew where it has stopped short. It will simplify the problem
if as a rule we only take the readings of the older texts into considera-
tion, a, b, d, e, f, k, together with the Vulgate Amiatinus ; the phenomena
of later and more mixed texts, such as c, g, k, l, r, d, though highly in-
teresting in themselves, will hardly throw light on the main question of
the assignment of q to the f or tothe b group of Old-Latin texts.

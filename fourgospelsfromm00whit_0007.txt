INTRODUCTION.

ᾧ 1. General Notz'ce. Some apology is perhaps needed for the length
of time which has elapsed between the first advertisem‘ent of this book
and its actual appearance. But though Ι went to Munich as long ago as
September, 1884, to revise the proof-sheets of the manuscript ¹ with the
manuscript itself, the large amount of labour which fell to my share as
joint editor of the second number of ‘ Old-Latin Biblical Texts‚' and
other pressing duties‚ have prevented me from working continuously at
the Munich MS. Even now my Introduction is not so complete asI
could wish, though Ι trust that the relation of the text to that of other
Old-Latin MSS. may receive fuller treatment in time to come at the hands
of Dr. Sanday. I have however spared no effort to make the printed
text a representation as correct as possible of the written one.

I was able to work for a little over four weeks at Munich in revising
the proof-sheets and examining the MS„ and my labours were much
lightened by the kind assistance of Dr. Laubmann, the Director of the
Hof-Bibliothek, and Dr. Wilhelm Meyer, then the Secretary, but now
Professor at Gottingen: to them I owe my thanks for their courtesy in
answering my questions, and in furnishing me with information, both
while Ι was at Munich, and also afterwards. Especially must I thank
Dr. Meyer for his advice, and for the assistance of his experience in
deciding difficult points in the MS„ and notably in the lectionary notes.

ᾧ 2. T itle and Number. The Manuscript is now numbered Lat. 6224
in the Hos-Bibliothek at Munich, whither it was transferred in 1802 with
the rest of the Monastic Library of Freising, in which it was numbered
24. Since the time of Tischendorf it has been cited as q. It is thus

the MS„ which had been bought by them with other similar material from Tischendort's widow
in Feb. 1883.

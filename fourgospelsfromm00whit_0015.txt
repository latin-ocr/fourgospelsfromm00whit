EX TERNAL DES CRIP TI ON. xiii

remaining pages of St. Luke (there ought to be five, but one is lost), are
bound up, as was noticed above, at the beginning of St. Matthew (Fol.
9—12). This would make six leaves, and the leaf after these, which had
the early part of St. Mark written upon it, is also missing, which makes
seven3 consequently F ol.' 156 ought to be the concluding leaf of this
quaternion, which has been partly lost, partly moved to the beginning of
St. Matthew3 and so it is, for the next leaf, Fol. 157, begins a new
quaternion3 following this is another irregular gathering of nine leaves
(Fol. 165-173); then a ternion (Fol. 174—179), and two quaternions
(Fol. 180-19 5). F inally, F ol. 194—202 was an irregular gathering
of nine sheets, but two leaves are missing. This brings us to the
end of the volume as originally bound, and by adding the restored
gatherings together, we may see of how many pages the Manuscript
consisted.

The notes which Ι have added to the lessons are principally the
suggestions kindly offered by the Rev. W. C. Bishop 3 the term ‘Am-
brosian’ refers to the Ambrosian MS. lectionary, the oldest known; a
proof of which Dr. Ceriani had sent him. ’

to mark a lesson have been attached, though the title of the lesson
itself has either never been added, or else has disappeared by being cut

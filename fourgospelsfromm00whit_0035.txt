RELA TION OF q TO OTHE'R OLD-LATIN TEXTS. xxxii

and b, though inclining on the whole to b ; every now and then f
readings, d readings, k readings, and also peculiarities come to the front3
in the 13th chapter, for instance, the agreement with f becomes more
marked, and in the 10th and 11th q inclines slightly towards a 3 but still
the relation with b, combined with fewer or more of the other Old-Latin
texts, is pretty closely maintained throughout.

If we now proceed to analyse a chapter or two in St. John we shall
find that the revision has been carried out rather more thoroughly than
in St.. Matthew: more of the characteristic Old-Latin and ⁶ Western'
expansions and interpolations have been deleted in common with f, and
several of the expressions have been altered into conformity with that
Manuscript3 but still the mass of the text runs as before with the older
European MSS„ a and b, and the general conclusion of its being the pro-
duct either of an earlier revision or of a hasty and less thorough revision
than that off, remains strengthened.

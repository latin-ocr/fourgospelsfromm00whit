EX TERNAL DESCRIP TI ΟΝ. ix

MSS„ the examples mentioned by Dr. Wattenbach seem to shew that
the practice was usual in German MSS. also; in his Schriftwesen¹
(p. 234) he mentions a MS. of the 11th century, in which the scribe
begs the prayers of his readers, ‘ pro indigno clerico Reginpoldo‚ quia
ipse laboravit in ipso libro'3 also (p. 235) in an 8th century MSS„ the
prayer, ‘ Orate pro Martirio indignum sacerdotem uel scriptorem,’ etc.,
and in another, ‘ Ego in dei nomine Uuarembertus scripsi ' ; nor must we
forget the well-known inscription in the famous Vulgate Codex Amia-
tinus οκυρις σερβαυδος αιποιησεν ². Dr. Wattenbach indeed there mentions
the subscription of Ualerianus in our manuscript amongst a number
of other instances collected and brought forward by him, so we must
conclude that signed Latin MSS. at any rate from the 7th century
onwards were not so rare as Silvestre seemed to think. Of the scribe
Valerianus however it seems impossible to obtain any information frorn
other sources, and beyond the fact of his having been the writer of this
MS„ he must, it is to be feared, remain a ‘vox et preterea nihil.‘

The statement in his subscription ‘ quia tribus digitis scribitur et totus
membrus laborat’ must not of course be taken of his having lost two
fingers of his right hand, but simply of his method of holding the pen.
Some ancient scribe, who had perhaps been twitted by his companions
with his indolent life compared with their hard work in the fields‚ put
the case of his class in an epigrammatic form which became almost pro-
, verbial. We might English it perhaps thus :—

Three fingers only hold the reed
But every member toils indeed.

The expression seems to have been a common one, and Dr. Wattenbach
adduces numerous examples of such subscriptions 3 a Wiirzburg. MS. of
the Gospels of the 7th century has ‘ Tris digiti scribunt et toturn corpus
laborat. Hora pro me scribtore‚ sic deum habeas protectorem ³.’ Warem-
bert, mentioned above, explains the expression, ‘ Calamus tribus digitis
continetur, totum corpuslaboratl We have also given us such variations

¹ Leipzig, 1875.

² Tischendorf, Proleg. in Nov. T est. A miatz'num (Lipsiae, 1854). The La Cava Vulgate MS.
is also signed (Danila scriptor). Since writing this a new and interesting discussion has centred
round this subject. See the Acaa'emy, Feb.-June, 1887.

³ An account and collation of this MS. has lately been published by Dr. G. Schepps (Die
Altesten Evangelienhandschrzflen der W iirzburger Universz'tc'z'tsbz'bliotlzek, Wiirzburg, 1887).

RELATION OFq TO OTHER OLD-LATIN TEXTS. li

words, we shall find it to have a far stronger resemblance to b than to
any other Old-Latin MS. It is of course a wearisome and difficult task
to note down the minute points—each inconclusive in itself—in which q
agrees with b against f, while it is comparatively easy and convincing to
point to the striking test-passages where in important questions of
reading q sides with f against ἃς but at the same time any student who
will take the trouble to examine it word by word with the other texts
will, I think, endorse my conclusion. I may add that at the present
time I am thus slowly, and I trust thoroughly, examining it verse by
verse, together with all the other Old-Latin texts, in connection with
the Vulgate, and every day's examination tends to strengthen this
opinion.

§6. History. Of the history of our Manuscript little or nothing
seems to be known beyond the fact that it formerly belonged to the
Freising Chapter Library, and with that Library was moved to Munich
in the year 1802. The life of Corbinian‚ the founder of the Benedictine
Monastery of Freising, and a typical mediaeval saint, has however been
frequently related3 the Monastic Library attained considerable fame,
and is mentioned by the translators of the authorized Version of our
Bible in their preface ¹. v

Corbinian was born at Chartres‚ near Paris, in the 7th century; he
shewed early a strong religious tendency‚ and whilst still young estab-
lished a small community near his native town: his fame both for
preaching and miracles, however, soon extended far and wide. After
fourteen years spent in this life he undertook a journey to Rome
(c. 714 A.D.)‚ for devotional purposes; but Pope Gregory II persuaded
him against his will to accept the office of a missionary bishop‚ and he
was accordingly consecrated as a ‘regionarius episeopus) He returned,
and spent some time in preaching throughout Gau13 after which he
again retired to his cell at Chartres, where he spent another seven years
with the brethren.

He then made a second journey to Rome with the intention of
obtaining the permission of the Pope to retire elsewhere for a life of

have caused about that time, the Gospels to be translated into Dutclz rhyme, yet extant in the
library of Corbim'an.‘

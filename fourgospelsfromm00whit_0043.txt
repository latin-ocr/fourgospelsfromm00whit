RELA TION OF q TO OTHE'R OLD-LA TIN TEXTS. xli

to the Italian, sometimes to the European family3 for instance οὐκ οἶδα
is translated, i. 26, 31, iii. 8, by nescio with f, against the non scio, and
zjg'noro of the others (ii. 9, iii. 8 f has non scis), but elsewhere (i. 33,
ii. 9) by zjgnor03 ἐμβλέπω is rendered by intueor in i. 36, against· the
respicio, uideo of the others, but in v. 42 of the same chapter respicio is
used, f moving round at the same time to intueor, whilst e keeps faithful
to uide03 μονογενής is rendered by unicus with a, e, in i. 14 against the
unigenitus of b, f, but in iii. 16 by unzgenz‘tus with s, ff2, while a, b, d, e
all have unicus ; unicus then would seem to be the older, and unigenitus
the revised form3 γεννηθῆναι is translated by the older rendering renasci
(iii. 4, 5, 7), whereas f favours simply nasci ; in the dissertation on the
text of the Bobbio MS.1 excito was noted as a possible African rendering,
but in John ii. 19 it is adopted by f against the suscito of a, b, q, while e
has the forcible and African-sounding expression restauro.

On the whole, then, the text of q in St. John seems to have suffered
more from mixture than in St. Matthew3 but the characteristic features
of the manuscript—a deep-grounded affinity to b, altered here and there
and revised into an agreement with f—though rather more obscured, are
still not entirely hidden. We think that an examination of the t'ext in
St. Luke will confirm this impression.

To avoid going over the same ground twice, we propose here to
draw our inferences from the analysis made in this Gospel in the 2nd vol.
of this series, with a view of determining the texts of ⁶²2 and 5².

In that analysis we took respectively a2 and s as our standards of
comparison, and thus many points in which the relation between q ands
or other manuscripts may be interesting are omitted, as q and f were
only cited when they threw light on the texts of a2 and s; but by using
this analysis for a second purpose what we lose in thoroughness we gain
both in the extent of matter examined, and also in what we may term
impartiality ; for in arranging data to illustrate any theory there is
always the temptation to lay most stress on those which fit the theory
, b'est and to omit or gloss over those which speak on the other side. But
when out of a previous analysis we select all those instances which have
anything to do with our present purpose we are tied down rigidly to
facts, and the testimony given as to the inter-relations off and q will be

The result of this examination of the earlier chapters of St. Matthew
shews plainly enough, we venture to think, the relation of q to b as com-
pared with its relation to f. Out of seventy-five instances there are but
sixteen of agreement with f against b; while there are thirty-four of
agreement with b against f; in one marked instance, the order of verses
in Matt. v. 4, 5, b‚f, q stand together against the other MSS. In five
instances b, q stand together against all the rest, in four q agrees with k
alone, in two with a and in two with d ; in six q presents a peculiar
reading, though in one of these (Matt. v. 13) a kindred reading is ‘found
in d and k. But still the substantial ground of the text seems of
the ordinary European type, and foreign elements intrude themselves
every now and then, rather in single isolated readings and expres-
sions than for any spaces of noticeable length. The analysis of
further chapters of St. Matthew‚ so far as it has been carried, points in
the same direction; the large majority of variants in q are variants
against f rather than with it, and the text oscillates generally between a .
